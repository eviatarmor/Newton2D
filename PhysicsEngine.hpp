    What is Newton2D?
    Newton2D is a 2d physics engine designed to work without any needs for a 
    graphics API.

    Do you have a physics background?
    I never studied any sort of physics until this project, i'm sure there are
    stuff that may annoy you physicist.

    Does this library has documentation?
    This library is still in it's early stages, and i'm sure there are still a 
    lot of bugs that can be found. so no.

    Where does the project name come from?
    I have two dogs, one is named Flutter ( as the condition atrial flutter,
    because he's hyperactive ), and the other one is the oldest Newton ( after 
    the name of Isaac Newton ).
